    <h3 class="type">Chord Chart</h3>

    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        The Chord chart marks connections between different groups.This graphic is popular because of its unique visual style, displaying the data radially with arcs displaying
        relationships inside the circle. The primary goal of the Chord chart is to show the flows between different nodes of data.
    </p>
    <h3>Marks & Channels</h3>
    <p>
      The marks used by the Chord Diagram consist of a series of lines or arcs inside a circle. The amount and thickness of the arcs represent the number of relationships between the
      differnt groups, thicker arcs indicate stronger relationships.

      The chord diagram can be quite complex, so it is crucial that channels are used correctly to reduce the complexity of the graphic. Among the important channels for this diagram
      are the position and thickness of the arcs. As mentioned above, the starting and ending points of the arc delineate the two groups being connected, and the width of the arc is 
      defined by the size of the relationship. Due to the complex visuals of this chart type, we also use color to differentiate between the arcs, often using a low opacity color to 
      aid in keeping the overlapping arcs seperate.

      Chord diagrams are quite popular because of there unique apperance, however if done incorrectly they can be messy and confusing. To avoid this we use a variety of channels to 
      clarify the graphic. For even larger sets of data we can use interactivity to further clarify the chart. The most commmon use of interactivity for this chart type is by adding 
      highlighting to the groups, which emphasizes the current group and its connections while being moused over.
