    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        Forced Direction graphs allow us to display relationships between different nodes in interesting ways. In the example I created, I made each node a friend in a group of
        friends. This person has several different friend groups with little overlap, so many of the branches of this are not connected.
    </p>
    <h3>Marks & Channels</h3>
    <p>
      The marks of the Force Directed Chart consist of shapes and lines, with the shapes representing nodes and the lines being the connections between them. In this example I used
      circles to display the nodes, however technically any shape could demonstate the node. One of the most important marks in the graphic is the lines, which are crucial for showing
      connections between nodes.

    <p>
      The channels of this graph type are less important than others, since a lare par of the information is displayed purely through marks. Channels can be used to increase the 
      understanding of the graphic, such as altering the position of the nodes to place like nodes closer to each other. We are also able to change the color of the nodes to group them
      to different clusters. In this example, I colored the different groups to match them to potential friend groups, which can help with the visual clarity. Another channel we could change
      is the line thickness between the nodes. This strategy is often employed to show the strengths of the relationships between different nodes, however in this implementation I did
      not include this functionality.

    <p id="bottom">
      Force Directed graph can be very helpful for displaying relationships between groups. A common usage of the chart is a social network which shows relationships between groups of
      people. Force Directed graphs are also very interactive, since the user is able to move the nodes around and see how it effects the other nodes. Due to this, the graphs can be quite
      popular, since they are seen as more interesting and fun to interact with.
