    <h1>Data Visualization Project 1</h1>
    <h2>About this Site:</h2>
    <p>
        This site and the data visualizations on it are part of our Data Visualizations class. The goal of this project, and 
        the class in general, is to familiarize ourself with data visualization best practices, and to learn how to better handle
        and display data. Data visualization can be used to provide evidence for a message, and even simple graphics can be highly persuasive. 
        For this reason, we should be cautious that are visualizations are unbiased and properly utilized.
