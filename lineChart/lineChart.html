    <h3>Marks & Channels</h3>
    <p>
      The marks for a line chart are quite simple, as they consist mostly of a singular line marking the change over time.

    <p>
      The channels of a line chart are also quite simple; it mainly includes the position of the line. Since the chart is a continous description of change over time, at each
      interval on the x axis we change the target position and then interpolate the line between these points. Line charts can also include color or stroke, however these 
      changes are not typicall necessary to increase the understanding of a line chart, and serve mostly for aesthetic purposes.

      Line charts are an increadibly universal charting type, mostly because of their simplicity and effectiveness. Line charts allow us to quickly see trends over time, and 
      plan accordingly. When looking at a company's stocks, a simple line chart will allow the user to understand how the company is performing. Line charts can also lead to 
      a meta narrative, seeing spikes in a companys stock value could show that the company launched a new product, or dips could show a change in leadership. Overall, while not
      the flashiest visualization, line charts are effective because of their simplicity and ease of understanding.
