    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        Services like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-sentiment.html">
        Amazon Comprehend</a> allow users to determine the sentiment of text.
        Using this software we could easily see the overall sentiment of an app or post given the sentiment 
        of the comments on it. Data visualization allow you to easily see general percentages in data, and view how they compare to one another.
        In the hypothetical data I created, we can see that there's a diverse spread of reactions in the comments, but that there are more negative
        or neutral comments than positive ones. Simple data graphics like this can easily be combined with other software to drastically reduce workload,
        instead of reading all the comments to gauge a reaction, we can instead view a handy visualization like this. Although it only gives us a rough estimate, 
        it can still be helpful in its brevity.

    <h3>Marks & Channels</h3>
    <p>
      The most notable marks within the pie chart are the slices of area within the graphic. Pie charts radially divide up the area into subsections indicating the 
      frequency of each result. This allows users to visually compare the areas against one another to determine which are most important in the dataset. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Color, a channel, helps differentiate the different slices from one another; and can increase the visual appeal of the graphic. Pie charts are also quite clearly influenced
      by shape, as the overall graph is a circle with radial slices taken out of it, instead of rectangular area like we'd see in many other graphics. We can also change the
      ordering of the slices to position them sequentially from largest to smallest, which helps in compairing the overall areas.
    </p>
    <p id="bottom">
      Pie charts shouldn't be used overly frequently, as there are better ways of compairing data than through angles or radial areas. While the graphic can be visually 
      pleasing, there are usually better methods of displaying the data. For more information about weakness of the pie chart, read
