    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        Stacked Area Charts show the culmination of several differnt factors over a period of time. While similar to the stacked bar chart, the primary difference is the continous
        nature of this chart, allowing you to graph data over a larger period of time. This chart shows how many quadrillions of British Thermal Units are produced each year in America.

    <h3>Marks & Channels</h3>
    <p>
      This charts marks consist of lines and areas to define the basic structure of the graphic. The area of each section can give us a quick idea of how prevelant that variable is
      in the cumulative dataset. The area also allows us to visualize trends in a variable over time, to see if it increase, decreases or stays stagnant.

      The channels for a Stacked Area chart are quite reminiscent of the stacked bar chart. Once again we see a great deal of importance placed on the height of each element, as we use
      the height to demonstrate the value of our variable. Another important channel in our Stacked Area chart is the position. Since we're overlaying our element on top of each other,
      it is important that we position them correctly so we can accurately gauge them against time. Finally, color is a very important channel for this type of graph. We use color in this
      case to differentiate the various areas, and provide contrast for the graphic.

      Despite their similarity to the Stacked Bar Chart, the data we're able to display with this type of graphic can often be much more detailed. While we are limited to a small number
      of vertical bars we can compare in the Stacked Bar Chart, the Stacked Area chart doesn't have such restrictions. This allows us to more easily chart continous data over larger periods
      of time. This does mean we lose some degree of clarity as to what an individual value is at a given time, so these charts can benefit from a hover-over tooltip to give more specific
      data. Overall, however these charts can be quite useful, especially when comparing themes and growth of multiple factors over time.
